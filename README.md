# Fortune Teller App

This app uses the basic knowledge of javascript arrays and the math.random javascript function
The program contains arrays with predefined events and then the math.random function is used to pick random strings from each of the arrays and store them into a variable. 
Another variable is used to concatenate the strings into a sentence which is a future prediction.
An alert function is then used to display predictions to the user.
